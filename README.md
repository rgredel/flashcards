**Flashcards app **

**What web app would it be?**

It would be an app where any user can create and modify own flashcards and 
decks. Flashcards can be marked as public so other users can find all of them or find 
them by category and in next step add them to their deck. Flashcards would be 
stored in a deck. Users can choose one of decks and start studying. User can flip 
flashcard to see the answer. After that user can select one of the states (I knew/ I 
didn’t know/ Skip). If the user knew the answer the level of the flashcard is 
upgraded. If the user didn’t know the answer level is downgraded. If the user 
skipped the answer the level is not changed.
When the flashcard gets to level 5 is promoted to completed and it’s removed from 
the studying deck.


**Who is this project for?**

The project is for any student who is looking for an effective way to study. Mainly 
it's useful as help to study languages, definitions, dates etc.

**What needs will it satisfy?**
It is more exciting than the classic way to study. It helps to memorize things for 
a longer period. Students can control progress, notice and improve weaknesses. 
Users can mark their flashcards as public so others can collaborate to prepare notes 
faster.
